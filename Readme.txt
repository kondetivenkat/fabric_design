 *** Fabric Design Application ***
 
 Overview :
 This project is a single-page application (SPA) developed using ReactJS and Fabric.js. The primary functionality is to allow users to upload two images: one of a human wearing a dress and another of a fabric pattern. The application processes these images to visualize how the dress would look if it were made from the uploaded fabric. Users can interact with the images, apply filters, and experience a responsive design across different devices.

# Features #

* Image Upload: Users can upload images of a dress and a fabric.

* Fabric Application: The fabric pattern is applied to the dress image with masking and warping techniques.

* Interactive Canvas: Users can drag and drop images on the canvas.

* Filters: Users can apply grayscale and sepia filters to the images.

* Responsive Design: The application is responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
